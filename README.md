# 👾 HCD | Exclusive design/app 👾
During the subject "Human Centered Design" (HCD) we are making a exclusive design/app voor a person who is disabled. This person could be blind, deaf or have 1 or multiple physical impairments. So our task is to solve a problem for this person that he/she encounters every day in work or private life.

### For who do I exlusively make my project?
Nicolette Besemer, who lives in Amsterdam and is a volunteer at Clientenbelang Amsterdam, has a physical impairment and therefore has difficulty using her laptop in daily life. For this she uses a drawing tablet with a pen that guides her through websites (or sometimes not). The task for us is to solve the "copy and paste" problem. This is not so easy with one hand that no longer has feeling, a pen that is not always accurate and the positioning of the pen or tablet is difficult to determine. A great challenge!
